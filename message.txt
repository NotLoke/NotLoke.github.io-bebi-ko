# To My Bebi,

I know it isn’t always easy being in a relationship with me. I know there are times when I don’t 
love you in the exact way you need, when I don’t always understand you right away, and when I’m 
still learning how to be someone you can fully depend on and feel safe with. I see that. I understand, 
bebi. I hear you.

I want you to know that I am trying. I’m always trying to grow, to learn, and to be a better partner
for you, not just with words but with my actions too.

Thank you for choosing me. For giving me a chance, for forgiving me, and for being patient with me even 
when it isn’t easy. I appreciate you more than I can fully put into words. I see how you’re trying to love 
me better, how you’re working on yourself for us, and how you genuinely show up as the best partner you can 
be for me.

If you’ve made it this far, then it only feels right to say this: you are my Valentine. I hope you enjoy 
everything I have planned for us. Please block off February 12 for our Valentine’s activities. I can’t wait 
to spend that time with you.

I love you with all my heart.

Marc
